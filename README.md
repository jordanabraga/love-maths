# LGBT Quiz - What do the letters mean?

The LGBT Quiz challenges your knowledge of queer indentities. When most people look at longer versions of the LGBT acronym, such as LGBTQIA+, they they don't what all this letters mean. The quiz is a fun way to bring awareness as the user plays against time to identify the correct term. At the end, the user is directed to a resource where they can learn more.

## Features

### Existing Features

- #### Start Card

  - As the window loads, the user sees the title ("What does the letters in LGBTQIA?") and is prompted to answer the question by starting the quiz.

- #### Quiz Cards

  - As the quiz starts, a time counter is displayed along with a question and multiple choices.

  - The LGBTQIA+ acronym is on top of the page. The color changes according to the LGBT+ raindow flag colors. This feature was added as a fun, gay detail, but it also highlights the acronym and creates a stronger assocation between the content and the question, "What does it mean?"

  - After selected, the question is highlighted in green (if right) or red (if wrong), and the next card appears. If no answer is selected after 10 seconds, the next question appears.

- #### Score Card

  - The score is provided at the end showing how many questions were correct out of the total.

  - A button with a special background directs the user to a resource about LGBTQIA+ identities.

  - Another button creates the option to restart the quiz.

### Features Left to Implement

- Different text and gifs depending of how much the user scored.

- Add a glitter effect.

- And if this were part of a bigger awareness campaign, content explaining different terms and a more questions based on a longer LGBT+ acronym.

## Design

The design is minimalist, fresh and gay. Details such as the colors of the LGBT raindow flag were added in order to direct the user.

## Testing

- I confirmed that the game score is always correct.

- I tested in different screen sizes to make sure the text is readable and easy to understand.

- I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar.
